# “Prework Study Guide Webpage”

## Description

This Study Guide webpage was created to help bootcamp students with prework notes to be structured, so that notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript can easily be found and read. It helps the students save time and focus on a specific topic each time they navigate the webpage. I further learned how to properly express code using technical language.


## Installation

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, go to each section containing notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Moreover, you can see JavaScript running if you open Chrome DevTool. One way to open it is by right clicking on the webpage, selecting Inspect, and clicking on the Console panel. It will list the topics we learned through Prework, and randomly choose which topic to study first.
